<strong>3 Main components: Tags, Triggers and Variables</strong> <br />
<p>Tag: Tracking code implemented on the site (ex: Event tag, Google ads conversion code, google analytics page view etc<br />
Triggers: Conditions when you want your tags to fire(ex: User signing up for newsletter. page view, btn click etc)<br />
Variables: Data points that can be used in tags or triggers</p>

<h3>When to use each?</h3>
<p>Tags - Track a conversion, implementing a chat widget, tracking a page view to send to google anayltics<br />
Triggers -When a form is submitted, a button is clicked - Triggers <br />
Variable - Fire your tag on page view, or specific page view - variable<br /></p>
